- In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

> 100’s = Informational status codes.  They may not indicate an error, but communicate at least that the header of the request has been received by the server.
> 200’s = Success codes.  They may not imply that the request was successful the way a user would understand it, but they at least communicate that the request has been received and passed validation.
> 300’s = Redirection codes.  The requested resource isn't where the server expects it to be, and the request may be shunted to a new location.
> 400’s = Client error codes.  These indicate something is wrong on the client side, like a bad URL or authentication.
> 500’s = Server error codes.  These indicate something is wrong on the server side, like the server being unreachable.
