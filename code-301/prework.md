## Behavioral Interview Questions

Question 1: What's your greatest strength?  
Answer: I enjoy being uncomfortable and out of my depth, because it means I can error correct towards being smarter and stronger.

Situation: At Providence, I supported a 24x7x365 telehealth program that started at Providence two months before I did.  We were figuring out all the processes and what was technically capable all at once.

Task: I had to take and give correction without judgment or rancor constantly, from other technical professionals and medical staff.  I had to be comfortable with a very protean working environment with some very heavy asks behind it.  Telehealth was a critical care line of business for us.

Action: I worked 60 hour weeks for a year while we got our systems and best practices in place, documented EVERYTHING and embraced the chaos with genuine joy and enthusiasm.  

Result: Telehealth was wildly successful and we spun up two additional lines of business within telehealth besides Telestroke, and I got promoted out of the department.

 

Question 2: What's your greatest weakness?
I have struggled with a habit of withdrawing from my peers when I feel that I'm failing, rather than asking for help.

Situation: At my role at Providence as an analyst, I had an integration project I was supporting between Epic and Phillips for teleICU.  I'm not an Epic analyst, I never have been, but I was the last person on the team with 'analyst' in my title after our Epic analyst quit.

Task: I was supposed to act as a liasion between two vendors and four hospitals, and ensure a smooth go live when Providence and Swedish finished integrating.

Action: I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing, and tried to figure it out on my own without asking for help.  This was a bad idea.  I asked for help from a much more experienced analyst - who also wasn't an Epic analyst! - and as we looked at the project requirements it became very clear that this was not going to be possible for someone without working experience of the Epic EHR.

Result: After the go-live got pushed back and we performed a RCA, it turned out we needed TWO Epic analysts.  It would have been better for everybody if I hadn't tried to solo an implementation.

 

Question 3: Why did you leave your last job?
I took medical leave to get some very overdue medical help from the VA.

Situation: In my last role as a business analyst for King County, I found myself struggling with some service connected problems from my time in the Marine Corps that were making it impossible to do my job well.

Task: In late 2020 I explained my situation to my employer, and took medical leave to seek help at the VA.  I had a medical separation a few months later, and started an intensive care program at American Lake.

Action: I spent over a year cleaning up my entire life.

Result: I got healthy, I relearned resilience, and I became much more empathetic and well adjusted.  I look forward to waking up every day, going to bed every night, and doing challenging work with intelligent people in between.


## Talk to your network

I am blessed with several mentors who are senior engineers and dev managers whom I am in frequent contact with.  For 301 I intend to speak with my friend David Ellis, a senior engineer at SheerID here in Seattle.  We've known each other for about two years, and we met in a parenting group when both of our families were expecting our first children.  Since David is an experienced senior engineer and is very familiar with data structures and algorithms I very much look forward to picking his brain during the course of the.. course.  I'd also like to learn more about SCRUM from him, as I aspire to be a SCRUM master later and he has had experience implementing the process.

## Professional Pitch

I'm Kyle, and I'm a software developer currently studying at Code Fellows.  Prior to this I did my best work in healthcare tech, spending 7 years in increasingly complex analyst and IT support roles.  I chose to pursue software development because the most fun I've ever had professionally has been working with engineering to implement the product team's designs.  I am certain that having lived in the support and product worlds gives me invaluable context for software design that I could only gain by first hand experience.  

I would like to use my powers for good and go back into healthcare tech at a small or medium sized company, where I can best leverage my previous experience.  Most of all, it's very important to me to know that the work I do could somehow help someone else who's struggling.  

Thanks for your time.
