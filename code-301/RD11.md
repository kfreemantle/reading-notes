- Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

> SQL vs NoSQL
 	 - SQL is relational, NoSQL is non-relational
   - SQL is table based, NoSQL doesn't have a standard schema.
   - SQL is vertically scalable, NoSQL is horizontally scalable
   - SQL uses structured query language to work with the data, while NoSQL uses UnQL to relate collections of documents. 
   - SQL is a good fit for complex queries, NoSQL is not (NoSQL doesn't have standard interfaces/tabular data format)

- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

> Non-hierarchical data.

- Give a real world example.

> A collection of demographic info, like names and addresses.

- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

> Hierarchical data.

- Give a real world example.

> IBM's Information Management System, per Wikipedia.

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

> A NoSQL database.

- Which type of database is best for scalability?

> Depends on how you want to spend your money.  SQL is vertically scalable, requiring heavier duty server components to add processing power.  NoSQL is horizontally scalable, requiring more server environments overall.

- What does SQL stand for?

> Structured Query Language.

- What is a relational database?

> A DB where information is collected and sorted into predefined relationships where data is stored in one or more tables of columns and rows.

- What type of structure does a relational database work with?

> Tabular data

- What is a ‘schema’?

> The way in which data is organized in a relational database.  It's the basic 'rules' for how data is organized.

- What is a NoSQL database?

> A distributed, non-relational database organized on a non-standard schema.

- How does it work?

> A combination of key value pairs, document relationships, graph values, wide columns, other terms I don't understand, and - I assume - voodoo.

- What is inside of a MongoDB database?

> Collections and Documents, i.e. key value pairs

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

> MongoDB, because it allows storage of unstructured data while still providing indexing support.

- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

> NoSQL DBs are not optimized for reducing data duplicity, but this is a minor drawback with cheap storage.  They DON'T use a standard schema, which means there can often be more exceptions to deal with than rules, so it can be difficult to structurally manage a NoSQL database.
