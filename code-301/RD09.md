# Class 09: Functional Programming

### Code review, lecture and reading notes


#### Assigned Reading Answers

- What is functional programming?

> A structural style that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data, per Wikipedia.

- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

> A function that reeturns the same result if given the same arguments, without deviation or side effects.

- What are the benefits of a pure function?

> Ease of testing, immutability.

- What is immutability?

> When a data state can't be changed after creation.

- What is Referential transparency?

> When a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.  Pure functions with immutable data are referentially transparent.

- What is a module?

> A logical,compartmentalized section of code that lives in a modules folder elsewhere in the application, and is called on when needed.

- What does the word ‘require’ do?

> Makes importing the module mandatory for the application to run. 

- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
