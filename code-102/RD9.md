### Career Coaching overview

- There are **[seven pillars](https://codefellows.org/get-a-software-development-job)** of career coaching at Code Fellows.
1. Professional etiquette
2. Professional pitch
3. Creating a network
4. Job search readiness
5. Targeted job search
6. Professional materials
7. Behavioral interview questions

- After code-401 there will be a **qualifying interview,** and a **whiteboard exam.**  These are very popular in tech for demonstrating your thought process when put on the spot to solve a problem.  Do you ask clarifying questions? How do you map out the problem into its smallest pieces, solving it step by step logically?
- The **qualifying interview** is how you get into the Code Fellows career accelerator program after graduation.
- You can put your profile up in the Code Fellows **talent portal** to be put up as a credible hiring candidate after graduation.
- Finding that first job after school is a **full time job itself.**
