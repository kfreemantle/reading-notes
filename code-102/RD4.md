## Class notes and reading assignment: Read 04

#### Clone is used to copy repos for work on different machines.

Having added the class repository with the **git clone https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-code-102d47.git** command, we can work on the class code locally.  We get the URL for the repository from the **green Code** button on the repo's Github page.  

### Wireframe and design of a site

- **Wireframing** is the practice of mocking up and planning a site *based on how the user wants to process the information.*  
- The purpose of wireframing is to get a clear, human-readable diagram of where everything is going to go **before building anything with code.**
- Wireframing is the [Nethack](https://nethack.org) of site design.  Start here and get your concept down first before you sweat about being fancy.
- Wireframes can be done as web based apps like [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) or [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), but for in person work a whiteboard works fantastically well.

### 6 steps to making a Wireframe
- With much guidance from the [Career Foundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/) page. 

Several different approaches to wireframing can be taken by UX designers.  The best process will depend on the projects requirements and constraints.

    Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
    Sketch > Code
    Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
    Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code)

1. **Do your UX research.** Wireframing is design from the user's perspective.  Different users will have different needs and pain points.  Create user personas and use cases, and understand how your product does and does not meet their needs.
2. **Have a cheatsheet for *everything***.  Organize your user stories, goals, features and pain points for quick reference.  Wireframing is supposed to be quickly adjustable.
3. **Map out the user flow.**  Your wireframe is not static.  You need a good map of where your users start and where they need to end up.  It is your responsibility to make the **information architecture** as intuitive as possible, maximizing users autonomy.
4. **Keep it simple, we're making sketches here.**  Don't worry about aesthetics, it's a problem for future Kyle.  Focus on the functional blocks of your site.  You're mapping utility.
5. **Add detail, start testing.** Start adding detail to the site from top to bottom, left to right.  Look for where to add things like **navigation elements, tooltips, basic user instructions and prompts.**
6. **Wireframe->Prototype.** Use a [higher fidelity mock up tool](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/top-10-prototyping-tools-2016-21619216) to get a working prototype of your site.  [Repl.it is another very good tool for collaborative mockups.](https://repl.it)

### HTML mock up notes

**[Helpful HTML documentation from Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)**

- Using a tool like Google Draw or Repl.it you can collaboratively mock up a bare bones site.  
- Map out the **body** of the page.
- Block out images, navigation elements, and any major text blocks.
- When you have a good mockup, start to **identify the HTML elements.**
- Mark up the **header, footer, main, and hyperlinks.**
- In the mock up, you could even include text boxes with drafts of code for your main elements.
- **Indentation** helps in your HTML to show which boxes live in which boxes (boxen?)
