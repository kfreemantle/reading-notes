# Terminals, Text Editors and the Command Line

## Reading notes for Read: 02

Both the **text editor** and **terminal** will be used frequently in this course.  It's important to be familiar with these two tools, as a majority of the work you'll be doing will take place in one of these two places.  A text editor allows you to modify the contents of files in a human-readable format, while the terminal is used to navigate and manipulate your computer in a more fundamental way than through a *graphical user interface.*

A lot of the work that will be done in Code 102 will take place in a **text editor.**  Selecting the right one is a matter of personal preference and style, but a few key features are universally useful.

- **Code Completion**: An editor that is smart enough to fill in the blanks on commomnly used phrases and terms will save a lot of time.
- **Syntax highlighting**: Visually contrasting different elements of code eases navigation.
- **Theme support**: Variety and comfort are important given how much screen time you'll be getting.
- **Extension support**: Better to make your life easier by using the add-ins built by people much smarter than you.

Additionally, we will be working a lot in the **terminal,** accessed in Linux with ***Ctrl-Alt-T.***  The terminal can be more challenging than the GUI, but is also more powerful in many ways.  Some of the basic commands are similar to DOS commands, but in the Linux environment it's important to remember that 1) files do not have extensions, and 2) commands are cAsE sEnSiTiVe.
- **cd**: Change Directory
- **ls**: List current directory contents
- **/**: root directory
- **~**: home directory, currently set to home/users/kfree

There's many, many commands to learn, and [no shortage of reference pages.](https://www.educative.io/blog/bash-shell-command-cheat-sheet)


## Things I want to know more about

I need to become more comfortable with navigating Linux in general, and the command line in particular.  I'm not even very comfortable installing basic software packages in Linux, and I intend to do my work on a Ubuntu laptop.  More practice is required!
