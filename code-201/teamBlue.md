## Team Blue



### Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

> Thomas, Jon, Kyle
> Jon: more comfortable with JS, less comfortable with CSS.
> Thomas: slightly stronger on CSS than JS, working on getting better at both.
> Kyle: knows someone smarter than himself who will help a lot with JavaScript.  More comfortable with JS than CSS.

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

> Given that we're most comfortable with JS between the three of us, we're thinking that we prioritize completing the JS and core logic of our application first as MVP, and then working on presentation layer after.

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

> Jon: desires to get more comfortable and confident in experimenting with CSS, rather than getting to minimum presentation and calling it good.
> Kyle: definitely wants more confidence in CSS and presentation in general.  Also, wants to be better about the design and planning of the code.  Needs more practice breaking the problem domain into solvable pieces.
> Thomas: wants to improve on domain modeling and breaking the problem down into pieces.  Desires continuous improvement in CSS.

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

> How do we deal with blockers?  - we're all in the same boat and at the same level of learning.  It'll be OK to call a time out to discuss what we're struggling with or stuck on.  
> How do we prioritize/assign tasks?  - if we have a really good design map, we can map out what the features we need to create are, and from there break the features down into sub-features and requirements.  We should front load our work here to save ourselves time later.
> How do we coordinate the above?  - ten minute stand up to check in on what our blockers are, what we need to have done by the end of the day, and what needs to be done the next day.  We intend to reconvene after an hour or two of work in the morning to see how and where we're stuck, and adjust our planning as necessary.  We will work ad-hoc for the remainder of the day but remain in close communication (we have a Slack group) and we can also take advantage of Remo.  An important part is to try and keep that morning solo time protected, as it helps us all calibrate how the rest of our workday.


### Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

> Open and honest communication, and an understanding that we're all new at this, and new at communicating about this.  If we're not feeling heard, it's OK to call a time out and say so.  We can add a conflict check to the morning stand up, and at the end of the day before we leave we can post it in Slack if there's anything missing at the end of the day we need to address.  Worse comes to worse, we can always ask Sheyna for help deciding the best course of action.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

> We don't anticipate this particular problem, as this is a pretty egalitarian group already.  We already are doing self checks 15 minutes into the project, and intend to continue.  If it appears to be too hard to resolve, we can ask for assistance from Sheyna or a TA to help us to re-organize our efforts.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? 

> If we have blockers that arise from a skill gap, we can check in with the team to update each other on where we're at.  If your team can't help you get unstuck quickly, then we'll inform the team that we're working with a TA.  We'll check in on how we arrived to a solution and give the team a quick note about how we got unstuck. 

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

> Honesty and empathy.  This is hard, and we're all learning.  We are here to fulfill the requirements and do our best.  Failing doesn't make you a failure, just be honest and specific.  If an individual is really stuck and can't keep up with a specific ask, we can reorganize our efforts and loop in a TA for advice.  It's the only way we're going to be able to complete the project.  

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

> We've built in TA and instructor assistance as a condition of a lot of our above steps, but to reiterate: if we are really, really stuck and can't get unstuck, we intend to loop in a TA or Sheyna for assistance and advice on how to reorder our efforts.


### Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

- What hours will you be available to communicate?

> In general we all understand that a Slack message late at night might not be answered immediately and shouldn't be expected.

> Thomas: has general 9-6 availability for school, and has availability after hours.
> Jon: same availability, general flexibility and OK with evening communications within reason.
> Kyle: open to communications in the evening, but has a toddler.  Not available from about 6pm-8pm and 6am-9am.

- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

> Slack is primary means of communication.  We're ok with checking slack before bed to make sure nothing has totally gone awry.  We do not intend to use SMS as the primary means of communication.  

- How often will you take breaks?

> As needed, but be honest about how much break you need.  

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

> We have check ins built into our group process.  Openness about where we're at and being explicit about how much time a task is taking will be needed.  We will bring it up with the group if a task is taking so long that we can't complete it.

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

> Covered above in the general communication availability.  

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

> We have a central slack channel that we intend to share group concerns and tasks, and we've been very clear about being unafraid/unembarrassed to ask for help and share struggles.

- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

> If you're feeling unsafe, reach out to whoever you feel safe talking to about it.  Worst case you can ask for help from an instructor, but we are an open group.


### Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

> We will be making a first pass of the project problem domain.  Once we have our design document complete, we can map out the tasks to a t-shirt sizing model, and divvy up tasks to a Github project board.  When we have our features defined, we can define our milestones as several features working together.

- What project management tool will be used?

> Github projects is first choice, we can move to Trello as needed.  

#### Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

Link to the shared doc in your project plan.

Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”


#### Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?

> All of the parts of the project other than Slack communications will live in Github, since we're publishing the repo to Github pages and using Github proejcts to coordinate planning.

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?

> We're going to try the organization functionality in Github, because none of us have seen it before.

- What is your Git flow?

> We will be using a dev branch before we push to main (production) and will have a separate branch for each feature.  Completed features will be pushed to the dev branch for testing, and we will conduct a code review before pushing to main.  The only time we push to main is when we have a completed, tested good milestone.

- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

> Yes we will.

- How many people must review a PR?

> Two people must review.

- Who merges PRs?

> In this case any of us can, so by default it would be the person who completed the feature and has gotten sign off from his teammates that would merge the PR.

- How often will you merge?

> We'd want to prioritize PRs that affect others as a rule.  As we work through the project, if we see that we have a PR that is affecting others on the team and we need it merged to unblock ourselves or them, we will poll the group in Slack to see if we can do a mini code review and merge the requests.

- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

> Slack!  We have multiple layers of ad-hoc review built in, and in Github projects we should be able to inform the rest of the team that a PR has priority and needs some cleanup.  In standup we will check and see if there's any open PRs.  When we generate PRs we will be explicit in our notes to each other.
