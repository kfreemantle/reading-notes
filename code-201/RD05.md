#### HTML Media

- What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

> For a screen reader to read a useful description of the image on the page.

- How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

> By providing actual, useful information in alt text for a screen reader, by choosing the right format for intended purpose and not being wasteful with the user's bandwidth, and by sizing images properly so the page loads in a less juddering fashion.

- Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

> If you were providing step by step instructions with images to follow along to, like Ikea furniture.

- Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

> A GIF is like a flipbook you'd make/get as a kid, and can show a simple animation.  SVG is like a drawing on graph paper; static, but nice straight lines and easy to see.  You *could* use a flipbook to plan out a kitchen remodel, but you probably would *want* to use graph paper. 

- What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

> WebP or PNG, with PNG or JPEG as a fallback.  WebP and PNG are lossless formats, WebP being preferable but not as widely supported as PNG.  JPEG is lossy and not preferred, but support is ubiquitous.  


#### Learn CSS

- Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

> Picture you had a colored piece of paper, and you put some plastic wrap over it.  You could draw on the plastic wrap with colored markers all you want and it wouldn't touch the colored paper.  That's kind of how background and foreground elements work.  They don't touch each other, they don't sit on the same layer, but when you're looking at them together they make a whole.

- Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

> I'd start by asking him his favorite color, and then finding a couple of websites that have that as the dominant color.  I'd see which of these extant sites looks best to him, then use a eyedropper tool to get the color from that site.  I'd plug it into paletton and get an acceptable accent color per its suggestions and see how the combo works for my friend.

- What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

> Generally, accessability across the broadest number of users, so I would choose from **web safe fonts** because of ubiquitous support, user familiarity and appropriateness to purpose.  Even if Wingdings is supported for example, the use case is hard to make.

- What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

> Font size changes the literal size of the characters, while font-weight and font-style affect **bold** and *italic* characteristics respectively.

- Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

> With the letter-spacing and word-spacing properties, affecting the whitespace between individual letters and individual words on a line, respectively.

##### Images in HTML, common types, choosing the right format

**Image tags** are used to put static images onto a page using the `<img>` element.  `<img>` is a **void** element, meaning it can't have *child content* or an *end tag.*  The image tag needs two attributes to function: **src and alt**.
- *src* points to the URL of the element you want to embed..
- *alt* is supposed to be a textual description of the image for use by screen readers or when the image can't be displayed.

Alt text is interesting and does a few things besides the screen reader thing.  Alt text is queried by search engines, and bandwidth is itself an accessibility thing for a lot of public users.  What we put in the alt text should be informed by what the purpose of the image is.  The [MDN Images in HTML page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML) is worth quoting at length.

<!-- Decoration. You should use CSS background images for decorative images, but if you must use HTML, add a blank alt="". If the image isn't part of the content, a screen reader shouldn't waste time reading it.
Content. If your image provides significant information, provide the same information in a brief alt text – or even better, in the main text which everybody can see. Don't write redundant alt text. How annoying would it be for a sighted user if all paragraphs were written twice in the main content? If the image is described adequately by the main text body, you can just use alt="".
Link. If you put an image inside <a> tags, to turn an image into a link, you still must provide accessible link text. In such cases you may, either, write it inside the same <a> element, or inside the image's alt attribute – whichever works best in your case.
Text. You should not put your text into images. If your main heading needs a drop shadow, for example, use CSS for that rather than putting the text into an image. However, If you really can't avoid doing this, you should supply the text inside the alt attribute. -->

Whereas the alt text is displayed when the image cannot be, **title** attribute is a label, not content description, even though they may be the same in some cases.  Title is what shows up on mouseover text.  Best practice is to include more necessary information in actual main content rather than in a mouseover. 

There's a difference between **html images** and **CSS images**.  The main HTML vs CSS rule applies, in that HTML images are *structural,* and CSS images are *decorative.*  CSS images have no semantic meaning, can't have text equivalents, invisible to screen readers, etc.

##### Image types/formats

The [MDN Image Formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#choosing_an_image_format) page is wonderfully comprehensive for common image types.  How do we choose the right one?  We choose by purpose.

- **Photographs** are for people to look at as a whole.  Lossy compression - which degrades image quality but reduces file size - is more acceptable with images than it would be with a graph, which is unpleasant to look at with blurred edges.  Use newer formats like **WebP** as your first choice and **JPEG** as your fallback.

- **Icons** and other smaller images you'll want a lossless format like SVG, WebP or PNG with PNG as the fallback.

- **Screenshots** should use a lossless format because you're supposed to be displaying the content as it was seen by the original user.  Use WebP or PNG with PNG or JPEG as a fallback.

- **Diagrams/charts** should be represented by a SVG vector graphics image if possible, PNG as a backup.  Lossless is important for crisp, clear lines.  SVG is almost purpose built for this.

**Fallbacks** are backup formatting options for when the primary image can't be rendered.  It's done using a `<picture>` tag to wrap the image content and precede the image tag with preferred source options:

<!-- <picture>
  <source srcset="diagram.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
  <source srcset="diagram.png" type="image/png" />
  <img
    src="diagram.gif"
    width="620"
    height="540"
    alt="Diagram showing the data channels" />
</picture> -->

##### Using Color in CSS

At the basic level, everything in HTML can have color applied to it.  At the most basic level, the **color** property defines the foreground color of an HTML element's content, and **background-color** defines the element background color.  There's way too much to go into for color theory, and you mistrust your own ability to tastefully select colors.  Don't put up with that.  Use an eyedropper to get your base color, then plug it into Paletton to get complementary colors.  

##### Styling HTML Text Elements

CSS properties for styling text fall broadly into two categories.
- **Font styles** are properties that affect text font, such as size, boldness, etc.
- **Text layout styles** affect spacing and other layout features, like space between lines and letters, alignment within the box, etc.

**em** and **rem** are font size properties that set the font size to a relative unit of measurement.  em calibrates it off of parent element, rem off of the root HTML element (default 16px per character).



##### Things I want to know more about

- The `<picture>` tag, and how commonly used it is.  It seems like I should ALWAYS use it but I feel like I've rarely seen it in the wild.
- I don't feel confident with color picking and I have bad taste.  90% of my clothes are shades of gray or black for that reason.
