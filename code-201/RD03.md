### Reading Assignment Questions

- When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

> When the meaning of the list is not affected by the order.  

- How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

> Using the list-style-type CSS property, targeted via a .class or #ID tag.

- When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

> When the order of the list is integral to the meaning of the list.  A timeline of events or a ranking of preferences are both examples.

- Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

> One is to use the type attribute inside of the ol tag to specify the bullet type, but that's only preferred if you need the original source document to reflect the bullet types for some reason.  A legal document with specifically numbered subsections in roman numerals is one reason why.  The better way to do it is to use the list-style-type CSS property as above.

-Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
> The Box Model: a one minute story about communicating healthy boundaries.
> Margine and Paddy were two friends who loved comics.  When they saved their money to buy a 1st edition of Captain Conditional, they were so excited to show it off to their friends!  Margine and Paddy agreed that when their friends came over to see the comic, they'd have to be careful that nobody got bumped around and accidentally smudged the comic.  Margine wanted to push any friends who got too close to their display back out away from the comic!  Paddy didn't think that was very friendly, and instead wanted to figure out how close they wanted people to get first, set up a border rope there, and then move the comic display an appropriate distance away from there.  Neither way worked very well on their own!  But when Paddy and Margine both helped with a *little* bit of standoff distance, their display looked just right!  Margine and Paddy were very happy with their comic book display.
-List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
> Content: the actual content that you want to display for your users.
> Padding: spacing between the box border and the content
> Border: dividing line with non-zero thickness between the padding and the margin.
> Margin: empty white stand off distance between the border of your box and outside elements.  Margins may collapse.

-What data types can you store inside of an Array?
> Any valid data types, including other arrays.
-Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
> It's a valid array, consisting of 4 different arrays.  The values can be accessed by calling the array with their indexes (indices?) as the argument.
> people[0][2] would give us 'librarian' as a result, calling the 2 index of 'librarian' contained in the 0 index item, which is an array itself.

-List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
> Algebraic ones are easiest!
> Addition: +=.  Adds to the left operand based on the right operand.
> Subtraction: -=.  Subtracts from the left operand based on the right operand.
> Multiplication/Division: *=, /=: as above, but multiplication and division.
> Exponentiation: **. Exponentiates the left operand by a factor of the right operand.

-Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

 > 10dog.  A and C can't concatenate because false resolves to a null value arithmetically. That leaves us with a concatenated answer of 10dog.

-Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
>A age verification prompt that kicks the user to another page if the user response to a prompt does not meet or exceed a appropriate numerical value.
-Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
>A while loop that does not allow the user to proceed past a login so long as the user name or password is incorrect.

### Reading notes

#### Learn HTML

### Lecture notes

We were shown a new way to do **concatenation.**  Instead of single quoting out, using + operators and having to deal with escape characters, you can use the **`** character, aka the PC game console key.  Any outside operators you need to reference, you enclose with **${curlymoney}** brackets.

> console.log(`It's $(userVariable) to save the day!`)

When using the .toLowerCase() and .toUpperCase() functions, you can just **append** them to the end of a prompt! Save some time.

> let userName = prompt('What's your name?').toLowerCase();   // the output is returned in lower case without extra lines of code.  Much more readable.

Getting into the lecture notes, we're going to start talking about more complex data types.  To start with, **arrays**.  Arrays are *containters* that hold values.  It's kind of like a list.  It's made up of a number of **elements,** each of which have a **index** in the array.  The *index* is a key identifier for the element in the list.  It counts up from **0**.  Put another way, **the index is place the element holds in the array.**

> let parksNRec = ['Leslie', 'April', 'Ron', 'Andy', 'Tom']

In this example, we have six elements, Leslie through Tom.  Even though there's *six elements,* the index value of Tom is *five,* because we count up from Leslie's *zero.*

Arrays can contain any data type, including other functions or even other arrays.  One of the most common combinations for arrays is **for loops**.  For loops run for *as long as the condition is true.*

#### Loops

Loops are functinos that run for as long as a condition is **true.**  Compare that with a if statement, which runs once.

 > if (condition) {
  // code that runs once, then moves on to the next line
 }
 > let i = 0     // the i stands for the 'iterator'
> i < parkNRec.length   // this part is used to evaluate the variable
> i = i+1   or   i++   // this is the increment to go up by.  i++ is a shorthand way to increment up by 1.

> for (let i =0; i < parkNRec.length; i++) {
  // this code will run as long as the condition for i evaluates to true.
}

let waffles = [`JJ's`, true, [228,343], `bacon`];
If you see brackets in JS, it's almost always an array.

Arrays can be updated with more values by declaring them by their index.
> parksNRec[6] = `Donna`;   // this added Donna at index 6 to the parksNRec array

Another method is to use the **push** function.

> parksNRec.push(`Tammy`, `Chris`, `Jerry`);  // this is a easier way, pushing however many more values you define in the arguments into the parksNRec array.  It adds them to the **end** of the array.

> parksNRec.unshift(`Tim`); // this slots the element into the front of the array and shifts the other indexes to adjust for it.

Moving on to CSS box model.

#### CSS Box Model

CSS is weird in how it calculates how content displays on the page.
 ![weird-css-sizing](csssizing.png)

Don't put up with that.  At the top of your css page implement **border-box styling.**  At the top of your CSS sheet, add:

> - {
  box-sizing: border-box;   // this code makes the CSS imaging rules behave the way you'd expect, where the box is stated in full pixel width instead of doing a bunch of math.
}

Let's look at **div** and **span**.  With a few exceptions, almost all HTML tags default to either display **block** or display in **line**.  Div displays block, span displays line.

- Block elements take up the **entire width of their parent element.**  They will go as wide as they are allowed to go.  Block elements will knock any sibling elements down to the next line.
- Inline elements are **the width of their content,** and flow with the content arouind them.

***Inline elements are meant to flow with the content!!***

The default rule can be overrideen with every element in the CSS sheet by using the **display** characteristic.  One option for this attribute is **inline-block**.  [W3schools has a great summary of how inline-block works.](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_inline-block.asp)  You can also use **float** to choose to orient the content to either side of the screen, but this can be finnicky.  Float is VERY good for wrapping text around photos.

With the CSS sheet we can also declare **classes** and **IDs** to apply our styling more selectively.
The class attribute can be included in the opening tag of whatever element.

> .class{
  width: 80%;
  background-color: gray;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-rigt: auto; // you want to use BOTh auto options, because otherwise it'll just smoosh up against one side of the page.
}

#### CSS psuedo selectors

You'll use a lot of these in the CSS Diner assignment for lab 5.  A **CSS psuedo selector** is a selector that targets its elements relative to its **parent** element.  

> div:first-of type {
  // styling to affect any of the first div child element of any parent
}

A **while** loop will run continually as long as the condition resolves to true.  This can be used in conjunction with a incremental counter to count or limit user attempts.  Remember, **a zero resolves to false!**

> let attemptsRemaining = 4;
> while (attemptsRemaining) {
> attemptsRemaining--;  // this decrements the attemptsRemaining by 1 every time the code runs, which it should as long as attemptsRemaining is more than zero.
> // code that runs as long as attemptsRemaining resolves to true.
> console.log(`The user has ${attemptsRemaining} attempts remaining.`)
>}

Another example of a for loop to count down questino attempts:

>let attempts = 7;
>
>for (let i=0; i < attempts; i++) {
> console.log(`The user has ${attempts} attempts remaining.`);
>}

One more example using an array from the lecture.

 let myFavColors = [`blue`, `red`, `black`];
 let userResponse = 'orange';
 let attemptsRemaining = 3;
 while (attemptsRemaining) {
 attemptsRemaining--;
 console.log(`I'm in the while loop. You have ${attemptsRemaining}`);
 for (let i =0; i < myFavColors.length; i++) {
   console.log(myFavColors[i]);  
   if (myFavColors[i] === userResponse) {
    console.log('You are correct!')
    }
  }
 }

let attemptsRemaining = 5
let userAnswerCorrect = false;

for (let i =0; i< attemptsRemaining; i++) {
  console.log(`The user has ${attemptsRemaining - i - 1} attempts remaining.`);
    for (let j = 0; j < myFavColors.length; j++) {
      if (myFavColors[j] === userResponse) {
        console.log(`You are correct!`);
      }
    }
})

##### Things I want to know more about

- Common pairings for nested functions, like arrays and for loops.
- Best practices for whiteboarding logical statements before committing ANYTHING to code.
- One problem I set aside for later was data validation for a single entry in an array that could have multiple possible values, i.e. Dungeons & Dragons being represented Dungeons & Dragons, D&D, Dungeons and Dragons, etc.. even before you get into editions.  I know I could use an array with multiple entries for D&D, but I feel like there's a more elegant way to do it with wild characters or something.
- With the guessing game, how can I deprecate a value in an array after it's selected?
