## Kyle Freemantle - Code 102 - Notes


My name is **Kyle Freemantle,** a student developer at Code Fellows.  I'm transitioning to development after 7 years in increasingly esoteric healthcare IT roles.  This page is my first student project, housing the notes I've taken for Code 102.  I am taking notes in every lecture with VSCode on a Ubuntu laptop and publishing them to my [GitHub page.](https://kfreemantle.github.io/reading-notes/)
