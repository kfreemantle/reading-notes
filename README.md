### Lab 01b - Markdown Practice and Growth Mindset

My name is **Kyle Freemantle,** a student developer at Code Fellows.  I'm transitioning to development after 7 years in increasingly esoteric healthcare IT roles.

***Notes on Growth Mindset***

To me a growth mindset is about flexibility, resilience, and most importantly, _agency._ To have a frame of mind that assumes that your own capacity to deal with challenges can - I strongly believe that a bad system defeats a good person every time, so it's important to have a mindset that is systemically strong.  A growth mindset is one that assumes that you'll encounter problems and challenges to your current modes of thinking, and that adapting is just part of being a human.  As easy as it can be to feel terminally discouraged when learning new skills, there are several ways to maintain a positibe and productive attitude.

- **Prioritize your problems.**  I am prone to myopically focusing on single frustrating problems to the detriment of multiple immediately solvable problems.  If I'm working without making any progress for more than 15 minutes, I need to remind myself to step away and use my time more productively for a little while.
- **Stay humble, stay curious.** It's ok to struggle and get frustrated while learning new tools, and learning new tools takes time.  I am working hard to stay mindful about measuring my progress against a past me, not some non-existant super-Kyle.  I will remind myself of this by reviewing what I've learned at the end of the day, and what questions I didn't yet answer.
- **Be honest and grateful.**  Sometimes, if we're not clear about what we want or why we're doing the things we're doing, we can spend a lot of time and effort in pursuits that feel wasteful.  It is important to me to regularly self-check my reasons for learning to code, so that I _do_ continue to be enthusiastic, curious, and grateful for the opportunity to pursue something rewarding.
