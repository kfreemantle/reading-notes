#### Assigned Reading Answers

- What is the difference betweeen SQS and SNS?

> SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe service, SQS is a distributed queuing service.

- What are some use cases for both SNS and SQS?

> SNS: If you need to publish and consume batches of messages and have multiple subscribers.
> SQS: for decoupling two applications and allowing parllel asynchronous processing where only one subscriber is needed.

- Describe how to use SQS and SNS in a “fanout” pattern.

> Per Amazon: The Fanout scenario is when a message published to an SNS topic is replicated and pushed to multiple endpoints, such as Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams, Amazon SQS queues, HTTP(S) endpoints, and Lambda functions. This allows for parallel asynchronous processing.

- Explain how “push notifications” work, using SNS.

> SNS can send push notifications directly to an app on a mobile device, prompting some user action.

- How might a large scale, distributed application make use of a Queue system like SQS?

> Per Amazon: Decouple microservices and process event-driven applications
Separate frontend from backend systems, such as in a banking application. Customers immediately get a response, but the bill payments are processed in the background.
