# Class 39: Redux - Additional Topics

### Code review, lecture and reading notes


#### Assigned Reading Answers

- What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?

> Configuring the store is complicated, adding too many packages to redux is dumb, Redux uses too much boilerplate code.  
> TL;DR it makes it more like create-react-app and go.

- What does configureStore() do?

> wraps createStore to make configuration easier, automagically combining slice reducers and middleware like thunk by default.

- How would I use createSlice()?

> By passing it an object full of reducer functions, a slice name and a state value, you get a slice reducers with corresponding action creators and types.

- What is Mobx?

> A standalone state management library to use with React.

- How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?

> By making sure that everything that can be derived from application state IS derived from application state automatically.

- How would we build a reactive user interface?

> Marking some properties as observable so MobX knows the values change over time, creating relevant actions that modify observable state, and connecting state to your components and trigger actions.
