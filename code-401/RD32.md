- How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

> useReducer and useContext are hooks provided by React that can simplify state management, especially in large applications.  They work at different purposes, but have good synergy with each other.

useReducer is a hook that is used for managing complex state logic. It is an alternative to useState that's easier and simpler to use when you have complex state logic that involves lots of sub-values. It lets you optimize performance for components that trigger 'deep' updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.  I still don't really understand what dispatch is, though.

useContext is a hook that allows you to create global state that can be accessed anywhere in your component tree without having to pass the state down through props to all the child components.

When these two hooks are used together, you can create a state management system similar to Redux but without the need for the extra libraries.
