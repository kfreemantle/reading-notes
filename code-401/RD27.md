### Code review, lecture and reading notes


#### Assigned Reading Answers

- Summarize the five steps of thinking in react.

> Mock up the UI, then break it into components like you did for wireframes.
> Mock up a static version in React without any interactivity.
> Figure out the minimum amount of representation of the UI data needing to go into State.
> Figure out which components are responsible for changing the state.
> Figure out how to allow state changes to pass from nested components back up to parent components.

- What is one reason a local variable isnâ€™t sufficient for managing a React component?

> Local variables don't persist between renders.

- What is the argument to the useState hook, and what are the two parts of its return array?

> The only argument is the initial value of the state variable, and after rendring you get an array of the state variable with the initial value stored, and the state setter function which can update the state variable and trigger rendering again.

- How can Component A access state from Component B?

> Remove state from component A and B and put it on their parent components.
