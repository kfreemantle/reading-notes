# Class 29: Advanced State with Reducers

### Code review, lecture and reading notes


#### Assigned Reading Answers

- What is the motivation for adding a reducer?

> To consolidate state logic outside a component into a single function.

- What are actions in the context of a reducer? How are they different than setting state directly?

> Actions are you specifying what the user just did, passed through the dispatch.  Setting state is more like you telling react what to do.

- What common list operation is useReduce named for, and why?

> The reduce() operation, because they take the state so far and the current item, and return the next result.

- When should you switch from useState to useReducer?

> If many event handlers modify state in a similar way, and/or if state updates are very complex.
