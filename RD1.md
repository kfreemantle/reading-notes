### 4 Markdown Basics

- Be **bold!**  Use the ** bracketing text to use bold typeface.
- Be _cultured!_ The _ character enclosing text will apply italics.
- Be ***boldly italicized!***  As above, but with _three_ *** characters.
- Be ~~striking!~~  Text you want to disregard but not yet discard is perfect for a strikethrough!  Enclose text with double tildes ~~ .

Between these four simple tips, you can accomplish 85% of your note taking goals with Markdown.
